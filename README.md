#Gif Tastic

## Instructions

* In the form, search your favorite athletes. It does not have to be your favorite, but search any athletes as you like. 

* Once you search an athlete, the athlete you just search up will be diplayed on the top of the form. Click the athlete 
and it will display an array of Giphy images about the athlete you just clicked under the form. 

* When you click one of the image, the image should animate as a gif. If you click the image again, it should stop playing.

* Just be aware, some images will take long time to load the animation when you click it. Please be patient:)
